In order to use this script you'll need a Coinmarketcap API Key, and a discord webhook link.


You'll find the API Key here: https://coinmarketcap.com/api/
You'll find the webhooks by following this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIZXDdVwNaE

Then update your .env file with the API Key and webhooks.

To edit the cryptos being tracked simply change `crypto_color_config` on `Line 24` with the corresponding colours (if you want)

Enjoy the simple little project I used to practice requests.
